        <h1>Voice Chat FAQ</h1>
        <p>
          This website is served by the Brickadia server you're playing on as an <a href="https://github.com/brickadia-community/omegga">Omegga</a> plugin.
          You can view the source or get the plugin for yourself <a href="https://github.com/voximity/omegga-voice">here</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Firefox issues</h3>
        <p>
          There are known issues with Firefox/Gecko browsers. If the voice chat is not working at all, it is suggested that you switch over
          to a Chromium-based browser, like Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Firefox is <i>mostly</i> working for you but newly joined users don't seem to be audible to you, refocus your browser tab
          every now and then. Firefox seems to throttle the JavaScript and sometimes prevents certain things from happening when
          the browser is not focused.
        </p>
        <h3>Verticality</h3>
        <p>
          Presently, verticality is only handled as distance- the farther away vertically you are from someone, the quieter they sound.
          This does not account for pitch (the up-down angle of your player) as Brickadia does not expose this.
        </p>
        <h3>Other issues</h3>
        <p>
